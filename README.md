# Puzzles
Some java puzzles with my solutions.

1. Reverse a String. If String == null or is empty we return an empty string.
2. Are two strings anagram? If any of String == null throw the illegalArgumentException.
3. Is a prime number? If the number is < 2 throw the illegalArgumentException.
4. Find the largest prime. If the number is negative or does not have any prime numbers, return -1.
5. Find the largest prime factor of a given number. If the number is negative or does not have any prime numbers, return -1.
6. Is palindrome? The palindrome number is number which when reversed is equal to the original number, for example, 121, 12321, -1221 etc..
7. Is cyclic number? Variable is String. If String number variable isn't number, throw illegalArgumentException. The cyclic number is an integer in which cyclic permutations of the digits are successive multiples of the number.
8. Find a missing element. A Variable is int[] range <0,N>. Each element of the variable is unique. The variable length = N. Return -1 if any number in the variable is outside the range.
